# HR Analytics (Power BI Project)

Here, the dashboard is designed in such a way that when I upload the CSV file with some details, it will display the data in the **Power BI Dashboard**, showing the details of "**Education Field**", "**Job Satisfaction Rating**", "**Age Group**",  "**Gender**".
The data will be displayed according to the department, such as "**Human Resources**", "**Research & Development**", and "**Sales**".

Please check the provided screenshot.
